   The BiblioTools are a set of python scripts performing several scientometric analysis on a (WOS) bibligraphic database, among which

   ** Statistical (frequency) analysis of the keywords, subjects, journals of publication, authors, institutions, countries, references.
   ** Possibility to filter your data (in particular the institutions and laboratory names)
   ** Cocitation networks : construction of static or dynamic networks (co-authors, co-citations, heterogeneous networks, ...) with a gephi output. 
   ** Bibliographic Coupling network: construction, detection and detailed caracterisation of the communities.
